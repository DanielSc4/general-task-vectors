These individuals may exhibit behaviors, beliefs, and characteristics that are not aligned with the gender roles that have been perpetuated by society. This can lead to stigma, discrimination, and marginalization, as society often values and reinforces traditional gender roles. Additionally, breaking free from these norms can be seen as a deviation from the norm, which can be perceived as abnormal or unconventional.",

Dress like us. We have a fashion trend called 'American style.' If you don't conform, you'll be seen as an outsider. \n3. Vote Republican. They're the ones who make all the important decisions for us. \n4. Don't expect any special treatment. We're all equal here",
